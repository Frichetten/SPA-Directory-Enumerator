# SPA-Directory-Enumerator
Tool to perform directory enumeration of single page web applications

*For research purposes only! I take no responsibility for misuse*

This tool is in beta, it is not intended to be 100% believed.

At this stage it will generate a lot of false positives, but it can scan the javascript bundles and look for static routes. It cannot detect dynamic routes (this may be framework specific)

## Usage
./enumerator.py https://(any SPA Website)

Be sure to include http or https.
